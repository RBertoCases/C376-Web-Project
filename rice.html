			<li><p>Set the caldero/pot to medium heat on the stove. Cook the bacon until the it is starting to get crispy.You don't want it burnt.</p></li>
			<li><p>Add the salt, rice, and water; and set the stove to high to boil uncovered. Don't stir the rice too much as stirring too much can cause the rice to be mushier than you would like.</p></li>
			<li><p>Once boiling, watch for the water to evaporate from the caldero until it's almost the same level as the rice.</p></li>
			<li><p>As soon as the water is at that level, cover the caldero with the lid and set the stove to low. Set your timer for 25 minutes.</p></li>
			<li><p>After 25 minutes, uncover and fluff with fork. All the water should have been absorbed by the rice. If not, recover and check on it every ten minutes or so.</p></li>

		<h3>Want to make yellow rice?</h3>
		<p>There is a super easy way to do so! Make the recipe as normal except add a packet of Sazon in step 2 along with the salt, rice, and water. It is a seasoning packet that doubles as a rice-coloring packet that you should be able to find in your local ethnic food aisle.</p>
