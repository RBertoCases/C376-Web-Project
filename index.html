		<p><img class="image" src="images/sadie.png" title="My dog, Sadie" alt="My dog, Sadie"  />Welcome to my recipes site! As a recent transplant from Tampa, FL, now living in Birmingham, AL, caribbean-style spanish food can be hard to come by. Almost everything spanish around Birmingham is based around Mexican culture. And while burritos and tacos are always delicious, I need some home-cooked style Puerto Rican food in my life and the only way to get it is to cook it myself. So I'm going to show you how to make a few Puerto Rican staples that are tasty and cheap!</p>

		<h3>About My Recipes</h3>
		<p>
		The recipes I'm sharing with you are my version of these Puerto Rican foods. I don't claim them to be entirely authentic to something you'd get on the island or even authentic to Tampa; they're pretty close though. I tinker with recipes until I've made them my own and I suggest you do the same with these.
